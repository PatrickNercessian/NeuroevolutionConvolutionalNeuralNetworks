# NeuroevolutionConvolutionalNeuralNetworks
Term Project for UGA's CSCI4560 (Evolutionary Computation). Evolving architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks

To Run: run setup.py

Things to Do:

Result comparison using different train-test splits vs same
Result comparison using evolved architecture, evolved optimizer, evolved both
Result comparison using epochs as an evolved variable
Neel's idea from a while ago, "list_labelsnoTumor"
